# Apache MXNet on PAI

This guide introduces how to run [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) workload on PAI.
The following contents show some basic MXNet examples, other customized MXNet code can be run similarly.

## MXNet autoencoder examples

To run MXNet examples in PAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.mxnet` with your own. 


Here're some configuration file examples:

### [autoencoder](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/autoencoder)
```json
{
  "jobName": "mxnet-autoencoder",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.mxnet",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 1,
      "command": "pip install scipy scikit-learn && cd incubator-mxnet/example/autoencoder && python mnist_sae.py --gpu"
    }
  ]
}
```

## MXNet image classification examples

### [image classification](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/image-classification)
```json
{
  "jobName": "mxnet-image-classification",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.mxnet",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 1,
      "command": "cd incubator-mxnet/example/image-classification && python train_mnist.py --network mlp"
    }
  ]
}
```

For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).

### Note:

Since PAI runs MXNet jobs in Docker, the training speed on PAI should be similar to speed on host.

We provide a stable docker image by adding the data to the image. If you want to use it, add `stable` tag to the image name: `openpai/pai.example.mxnet:stable`.
