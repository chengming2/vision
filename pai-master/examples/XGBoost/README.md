# XGBoost on PAI

This guide introduces how to run [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) workload on PAI.
The following contents show some basic XGBoost examples, other customized XGBoost code can be run similarly.

## XGBoost covertype dataset classification example

To run XGBoost examples in PAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.xgboost` with your own. 

Here's one configuration file example to train a model on the [forest cover type](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype) dataset using GPU acceleration:

### [gpu_hist](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/gpu_acceleration/cover_type.py)

```json
{
  "jobName": "xgboost_gpu_hist",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.xgboost",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 1,
      "command": "pip install -q sklearn && python demo/gpu_acceleration/cover_type.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).
