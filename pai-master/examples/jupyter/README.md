# Jupyter on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) on OpenPAI.
The following contents show some basic examples, other customized examples can be run similarly.



## Jupyter Notebook example

To run Jupyter Notebook in OpenPAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.caffe` with your own. 

Here's one configuration file example to use Jupyter Notebook as a tutorial to run a tensorflow mnist example:

### Job configuration file

```json
{
    "jobName": "jupyter_example",
    "image": "openpai/pai.example.tensorflow",
    "taskRoles": [
        {
            "name": "jupyter",
            "taskNumber": 1,
            "cpuNumber": 4,
            "memoryMB": 8192,
            "gpuNumber": 1,
            "portList": [
                {
                    "label": "jupyter",
                    "beginAt": 0,
                    "portNumber": 1
                }
            ],
            "command": "python3 -m pip install -q jupyter matplotlib && wget -O mnist.ipynb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianlewis/tensorflow-examples/master/notebooks/TensorFlow%20MNIST%20tutorial.ipynb && jupyter notebook --allow-root --no-browser --ip 0.0.0.0 --port=$PAI_CONTAINER_HOST_jupyter_PORT_LIST --NotebookApp.token=\"\" --NotebookApp.allow_origin=\"*\" --NotebookApp.base_url=\"/jupyter\""
        }
    ]
}
```

For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).

### Access Jupyter Notebook

Once the job is successfully submitted to PAI, you can view job info in webportal, and access your Jupyter Notebook via http://${container_ip}:${container_port}/jupyter/notebooks/mnist.ipynb.

for example, from the above job info page, you can access your Jupyter Notebook via http://10.151.40.202:4836/jupyter/notebooks/mnist.ipynb
