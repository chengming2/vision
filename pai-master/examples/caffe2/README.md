# Apache Caffe2 on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [Caffe2](https://caffe2.ai/) job on OpenPAI.
The following contents show some basic Caffe2 examples, other customized Caffe2 code can be run similarly.

# Caffe2 resnet50 ImageNet example

To run Caffe2 examples in OpenPAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.caffe2` with your own. 

Here's one configuration file example:

### [resnet50](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/caffe2/python/examples/resnet50_trainer.py)
```json
{
  "jobName": "caffe2-resnet50",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.caffe2",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 1,
      "command": "python resnet50_trainer.py --train_data null"
    }
  ]
}
```

For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).
