# MPI on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) workload on OpenPAI.
The following contents show some basic Open MPI examples, other customized MPI code can be run similarly.

# CNTK CIFAR-10 example

### Prepare work
1. Prepare the data:
* CNTK: Download all files in https://git.io/vbT5A `wget https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/raw/master/Examples/SequenceToSequence/CMUDict/Data/cmudict-0.7b` and put them up to HDFS:`hdfs dfs -put filename hdfs://ip:port/examples/cntk/data` or `hdfs dfs -put filename hdfs://ip:port/examples/mpi/cntk/data`.
Note that we use the same data as cntk example. So, if you have already run that example, just use that data path.
2. Prepare the executable code:
* cntk: Download the script example from [github](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai/blob/master/examples/mpi/cntk-mpi.sh)`wget https://github.com/Microsoft/pai/raw/master/examples/mpi/cntk-mpi.sh`. Then upload them to HDFS:`hdfs dfs -put filename hdfs://ip:port/examples/mpi/cntk/code/`
3. Prepare a docker image and upload it to docker hub.  OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.cntk` with your own.
4. Prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal. The config examples are following.

**Note** that you can simply run the prepare.sh to do the above preparing work, but you must make sure you can use HDFS client on your local machine. If you can, just run the shell script with a parameter of your HDFS socket! `/bin/bash prepare.sh ip:port`

Here's a configuration file examples:
