# CNTK on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/) job on OpenPAI.
The following contents show some basic CNTK examples, other customized CNTK code can be run similarly.

# CNTK grapheme-to-phoneme examples

### prepare
To run CNTK examples in OpenPAI, you need to do the following things:
1. Prepare the data by downloading all files in https://git.io/vbT5A(`wget https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/raw/master/Examples/SequenceToSequence/CMUDict/Data/cmudict-0.7b`) and put them up to HDFS:`hdfs dfs -put filename hdfs://ip:port/examples/cntk/data`.
2. Prepare the executable code(`wget https://github.com/Microsoft/pai/raw/master/examples/cntk/cntk-g2p.sh`) and config(`wget https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/raw/master/Examples/SequenceToSequence/CMUDict/BrainScript/G2P.cntk`). And upload them to HDFS:`hdfs dfs -put filename hdfs://ip:port/examples/cntk/code`.
3. Prepare a docker image and upload it to docker hub. You can get the tutorial below.
4. Prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.
Note that you can simply run the prepare.sh to do the above preparing work, but you must make sure you can use HDFS client on your local machine. If you can, just run the shell script with a parameter of your HDFS socket!`/bin/bash prepare.sh ip:port`


OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.caffe` with your own. 

Here're some configuration file examples, pay attention to the codeDir/dataDir/outputDir, they must be the same as the path that you upload your code and data to:

### [grapheme-to-phoneme](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Examples/SequenceToSequence/CMUDict)
```js
{
  "jobName": "cntk-g2p",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.cntk",

  // prepare cmudict corpus in CNTK format https://git.io/vbT5A and upload to hdfs
  "dataDir": "$PAI_DEFAULT_FS_URI/examples/cntk/data",
  // make a new dir for output on hdfs
  "outputDir": "$PAI_DEFAULT_FS_URI/examples/cntk/output",
  // prepare g2p training script cntk-example.sh and upload to hdfs
  "codeDir": "$PAI_DEFAULT_FS_URI/examples/cntk/code",

  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "g2p_train",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 8,
      "memoryMB": 16384,
      "gpuNumber": 1,
      "command": "cd code && /bin/bash cntk-g2p.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

When the job finished and succeeded, you can get the output of the example from HDFS:`hdfs dfs -get hdfs://ip:port/examples/cntk/output`.

For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).
