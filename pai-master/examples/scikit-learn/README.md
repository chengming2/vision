# scikit-learn on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) job on OpenPAI.
The following contents show some basic scikit-learn examples, other customized scikit-learn code can be run similarly.

## scikit-learn MNIST digit recognition example

To run scikit-learn examples in OpenPAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.sklearn` with your own. 

Here're some configuration file examples:

### [mnist](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/benchmarks/bench_mnist.py)
```json
{
  "jobName": "sklearn-mnist",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.sklearn",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 0,
      "command": "cd scikit-learn/benchmarks && python bench_mnist.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

## scikit-learn text-vectorizers example

### [text-vectorizers](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/benchmarks/bench_text_vectorizers.py)
```json
{
  "jobName": "sklearn-text-vectorizers",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.sklearn",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 0,
      "command": "pip install memory_profiler && cd scikit-learn/benchmarks && python bench_text_vectorizers.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).

### Note:

Since PAI runs PyTorch jobs in Docker, the training speed on PAI should be similar to speed on host.

We provide a stable docker image by adding the data to the image. If you want to use it, add `stable` tag to the image name: `openpai/pai.example.sklearn:stable`.
