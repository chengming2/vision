# OCR serving on PAI

This example introduces how to run an OCR serving job on OpenPAI, 


Please note that it's a simple demo, don't use it directly in production environments.



## Prepare Docker image

To provide a more simple experience, we have prepared an image of `openpai/pai.example.ocr-serving`, 
you could also prepare your own image with following steps.

1. Build a base Docker image to pack necessary basic libraries for OpenPAI.
    We prepared a [base Dockerfile](../Dockerfiles/cuda9.0-cudnn7/Dockerfile.build.base) which can be built directly.

    ```bash
    $ cd ../Dockerfiles/cuda9.0-cudnn7
    $ sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.build.base \
    >                   -t pai.build.base:hadoop2.7.2-cuda9.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04 .
    $ cd -
    ```

2. Prepare the OCR serving Docker image, which includes OCR and web-server libraries. 
    It can be built with following command.

    ```
    $ sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.example.ocr-serving -t pai.example.ocr-serving .
    ```

    Then push the Docker image to a Docker registry:

    ```bash
    $ sudo docker tag pai.example.ocr-serving USER/pai.example.ocr-serving
    $ sudo docker push USER/pai.example.ocr-serving
    ```
    Please replace USER with the Docker Hub username you registered, you will be required to login before pushing Docker image.



## Submit job

To use the OCR demo docker image on OpenPAI, you will need to submit a job with the command to config the port for the OCR web-server and start the service in docker. 

The full OCR job description is shown as belowï¼š
```json
{
  "jobName": "ocr-serving",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.ocr-serving",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "serving",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 0,
      "portList": [
        {
          "label": "model_server",
          "beginAt": 0,
          "portNumber": 1
        }
      ],
      "command": "python3 app.py -p $PAI_CONTAINER_HOST_model_server_PORT_LIST"
    }
  ],
  "retryCount": -2
}
```
*For more details on how to write a job configuration file, 
please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).*

After submitting this job, it might take few mins for OpenPAI to load docker image and deploy the service.

## Access service

OpenPAI will dynamic allocate resources, IP and Port for jobs. 
Dynamic allocated IP and Port can be found in the job detail page, with which
users could access the web-server
