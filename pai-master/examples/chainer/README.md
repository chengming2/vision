# Chainer on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [Chainer](https://chainer.org/) job on OpenPAI.
The following contents show a basic Chainer example, other customized Chainer code can be run similarly.

## Contents

1. [Chainer examples](#chainer-example)
2. [Customize Docker Env](#customize-docker-env)

## Chainer CIFAR-100 image classification example

To run Chainer examples in OpenPAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.chainer` with your own. 

Here're some configuration file examples:

### [cifar](https://github.com/chainer/chainer/tree/master/examples/cifar)

```json
  "jobName": "chainer-cifar",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.chainer",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 1,
      "command": "python ./chainer/examples/cifar/train_cifar.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).
