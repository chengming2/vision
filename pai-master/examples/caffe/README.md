# Caffe on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) job on OpenPAI.
The following contents show some basic Caffe examples, other customized Caffe code can be run similarly.

# Caffe lenet MNIST digit recognition example

To run Caffe examples in OpenPAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.caffe` with your own. 

Here's one configuration file example:

### [mnist](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/mnist.html)

```json
{
  "jobName": "caffe-mnist",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.caffe",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 1,
      "command": "./data/mnist/get_mnist.sh && ./examples/mnist/create_mnist.sh && ./examples/mnist/train_lenet.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```
For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).
