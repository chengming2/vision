# PyTorch on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) job on OpenPAI.
The following contents show some basic PyTorch examples, other customized PyTorch code can be run similarly.

## PyTorch MNIST digit recognition examples

To run PyTorch examples in OpenPAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

OpenPAI packaged the docker env required by the job for user to use. User could refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) to customize this example docker env. If user have built a customized image and pushed it to Docker Hub, replace our pre-built image `openpai/pai.example.pytorch` with your own. 

Here're some configuration file examples:

### [mnist](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist)
```json
{
  "jobName": "pytorch-mnist",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.pytorch",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 1,
      "command": "cd examples/mnist && python main.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

## PyTorch regression examples

### [regression](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/regression)
```json
{
  "jobName": "pytorch-regression",
  "image": "openpai/pai.example.pytorch",
  "taskRoles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "cpuNumber": 4,
      "memoryMB": 8192,
      "gpuNumber": 0,
      "command": "cd examples/regression && python main.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/user/training.md).

## Note:

Since PAI runs PyTorch jobs in Docker, the training speed on PAI should be similar to speed on host.
