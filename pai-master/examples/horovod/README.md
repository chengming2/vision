# Horovod with mpi on OpenPAI

This guide introduces how to run [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) workload on OpenPAI.
We use [tensorflow benchmark](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/cnn_tf_v1.10_compatible/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks) as the example. It seems impossible to run it just with openmpi and tensorflow.
So, we use [horovod](https://github.com/uber/horovod) as the runtime environment to run the example.
Other customized MPI code can be run similarly.

# Open MPI TensorFlow CIFAR-10 example

### Prepare work
1. Prepare the data:
* TensorFlow: Just go to the [official website](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and download the python version data by the [url](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz). `wget http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz && tar zxvf cifar-10-python.tar.gz && rm cifar-10-python.tar.gz`
After you downloading the data, upload them to HDFS:`hdfs dfs -put filename hdfs://ip:port/examples/mpi/tensorflow/data` or `hdfs dfs -put filename hdfs://ip:port/examples/tensorflow/distributed-cifar-10/data`
Note that we use the same data as [tensorflow distributed cifar-10 example](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai/tree/master/examples/tensorflow). So, if you have already run that example, just use that data path.
2. Prepare the executable code:
* Tensorflow: We use [tensorflow benchmark](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/cnn_tf_v1.10_compatible) as the example code. Pay attention to the version, the example here uses v1.10 code.
3. Prepare a docker image and upload it to docker hub. We use the [horovod official image](https://hub.docker.com/r/uber/horovod/tags/), tag `0.14.1-tf1.10.0-torch0.4.0-py2.7`. If you want to use a customized image, just refer to the [official Docker file](https://github.com/uber/horovod/blob/master/Dockerfile) and make your own. Then, build it and push the image onto docker hub.
4. Prepare a script in order to detest whether the containers are ready before run the mpi job. [Here](./start.sh) is an example.
5. Prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal. The config examples are following.

**Note:** you can run the `prepare.sh` to do the above preparing work, make sure you have installed HDFS client before. 
```
export HADOOP_USER_NAME=root
bash prepare.sh {hdfs_uri} {pai_username}
```

Here is a configuration file example:

### [TensorFlow cifar10 benchmark](https://git.io/vF4wT)

```js

    }
  ]
}
```
